= Spring Data Neo4j Example Project

This project uses the Marvel comic data set to demonstrate using Spring Data and Neo4j together.
The following components are part of the project:

1. Neo4j database - https://dev.neo4j.com/sandbox[sandbox^], https://dev.neo4j.com/aura[Aura free tier^], or https://dev.neo4j.com/desktop[local instance].
2. Marvel comic data set loaded to Neo4j - Cypher statements in this repository (requires API key).
3. Spring Boot application using Spring Data Neo4j (SDN) - https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data project^] for integration with Neo4j.

The application is a read-only interface to query and explore the data.
It is using the reactive capabilities of Spring Data Neo4j. For imperative functionality, please see the https://github.com/JMHReif/sdn-marvel-basic[related Github project^].

== Data set

"Data provided by Marvel. Â© 2014 Marvel"

More details on getting an API key to load the data can be found on https://github.com/JMHReif/graph-demo-datasets/tree/main/marvel-comics[another Github repository^].
Note that this project uses a subset (only characters and comic issues) of the full Marvel data set.

== Data load

Create an instance of Neo4j and go to the https://developer.marvel.com/[Marvel API] to create an account and request an API key.
Once that is granted, copy/paste the statements from the `marvel-load-data.cypher` file in this repository (substituting your keys in the first statement to set parameters).
Clone this repository from Github, update the credentials in this project's `application.properties` file to match those for your database instance, then run the project.
